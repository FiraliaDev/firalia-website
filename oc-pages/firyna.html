          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Firyna is a shard of Azem and the final Warrior of Light of the Thirteenth. Having descended from a family with strong
            connections to Hydaelyn (as marked by the crystal flower tattoo on her nose), she awoke to the echo at a young age,
            and at a much higher potency than that seen in Hydaelyn's chosen of the current era.
          </p>
          <p>
            Described by those close to her as "an endearing inconvenience",
            Firyna finds amusement in summoning her friend Zeraenik across the realm for various strange
            and pointless missions that she most certainly could have handled on her own.
          </p>
          <p>
            She has a passion for folklore and
            loves to travel and help people while learning about different cultures.
            She has a particular infatuation with a wide-spread tale told to children about a long-lost city of dreams.

        <p>
          The echo was a dying gift at the time of Firyna's birth. Where once upon a time,
          you'd be hard pressed to find those without it,
          now those who awoke to the power were few and far between. Of those with it,
          most were descendants of a handful of proud families to whom Hydaelyn was said to whisper.
          Firyna was born into one such family—as marked by the crystalline tattoo on her nose, one of many family symbols in her village.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether or not she would awaken to the gift was debated by many, but to their considerable surprise,
          she awoke to it at the age of six summers following a nightmare of the world's end.
          Upon recounting that which she had seen, she was brushed off by many. The "City of Dreams"—as it was often referred to as—was
          a mere children's story passed down from their ancestors.
          Whether or not there was any truth to it was highly debated,
          but the fact of the matter was that no one had claimed to have seen it in hundreds of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that moment onwards, she was plagued by the voice of Hydaelyn in the backs of her mind.
          It was a constant companion determined to influence her thoughts and actions,
          but Firyna was ever a stubborn thing beyond the control of even her closest friend Zeraenik.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her and Zez were constant companions throughout the years. When she dreamt of the city, she confided in him.
          When the voice plagued her thoughts, it was he who grounded her.
          Though Hydaelyn fought tooth and nail to stop her, she was determined to to let her curiosity find the truth
          of that which had plagued her all her life.
          And so it was that when she came of age to leave the village, Zez waved her off with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          She travelled the world before settling amongst a group of researchers who toiled to
          uncover the ruins of the fabled city that they believed was real.
          Upon what would become their greatest mission yet, they uncovered a handful of oversized crystals
          that were thought to be conduits through which to channel aether.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a bout of recklessness, Firyna decided to use her crystal of light to channel aether into it,
          and succeeded in partially giving form to a key-like necklace.
          This lead her to attract the attention of a woman named Ines, who claimed to trace her family line
          back to the ancients, and was in possession of valuable knowledge cultivated through generational preservation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ines lead Firyna to the ruins of the City of Dreams, better known as Amaurot.
          There she revealed her true identity as Igeyorhm, and became the catalyst that would spark the
          destruction of the shard by way of Firyna's death.
