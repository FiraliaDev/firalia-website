          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Athens is the older brother of Cynthia, and twin brother of Altheia.<br>
            He is a soft and quiet person, with a love for animals and nature that lead him to becoming a frequent visitor of Elpis throughout the course of his work. 
            His primary occupation, prior to the Final Days, was as a vigneron at the family farm on a volcanic island to the East.
          </p>
          <p>
            When his sisters left for Amaurot, he stayed behind for his love of nature and their village. However, he often visited the two when he had the chance.
            It was said that his wines were one of the few things that could stop even Emet-Selch's grumbling, and the couple looked forward to his latest batches with every visit.
