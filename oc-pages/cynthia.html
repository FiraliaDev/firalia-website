          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Cynthia was the final Azem prior to the sundering. She was known across the realm as a bundle of mischief with a kind and earnest heart.
            There were none more loved and respected than her, and while her methods were at times questionable,
            none could deny the results of her work, nor Venat's reasons for choosing her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though she was often perceived as reckless, that could not be further from the truth.
            In fact, everything she did was meticulously thought out.
            Though the difference between her and the rest of the Convocation was that she lived by her own set of morals,
            and while she respected the rules and restrictions of their society, she never let them define or restrict her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She loved Etheirys and its people with all her heart, and everything she did was for them.
            Her friends—and perhaps most of all, Hades—knew of this.
            They knew they could never stop her from embarking on a new adventure at her heart's behest.
            And so, they relished every moment she was home, and waved her off with a smile.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Cynthia was born on a volcanic isle in the East known for its cultivation of grapes for harvest in the realm's finest wines.
          It was a close-knit community of farmers—one of the few still dedicated to the pursuit of traditional harvest.
          She had a loving mother and father, and twin older siblings.
          The eldest of them all—Altheia—was close as could be with Cynthia, and an absolute enabler of her antics.
          Their brother Athens, on the other hand, always seemed to be running after the two out of worry.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she came of age, Cynthia and Altheia left their village in the hopes of making a grander life for themselves in Amaurot.
          It was there, amidst her studies, that she would would meet Hades and Hythlodaeus, as well as catch the eye of Venat.<br>
          It wasn't until after Cynthia had become Azem, and Hades had become Emet-Selch, that the two got together officially.
          They seemed to balance each other out perfectly.
          Her flame ignited his soul with life, and when it got out of control, he was there to quell the fires while still nurturing the flame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything seemed perfect...until the Final Days manifested. <br>
          It seemed a fairytale when she first heard news of it in the East,
          but no report could describe the horror that met her when she set foot in the home she had saved from destruction just weeks before.
          Fire and monsters; death and decay. Buildings crumbled, and naught but the shrill cries of foul beasts filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her father was dead, and with her mother's dying breath, she bade her find her brother and save what few had escaped underground.
          When she returned to Amaurot—refugees in tow—it was clear to all who knew her that she was different.
          Stricken by grief and despair like she'd never felt before,
          she made it her mission to stop the corruption from spreading whatever the cost.
          However, the Convocation forbade her from leaving Amaurot, that she might lend her first-hand knowledge to their pursuit of a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Final Days spread, slowly at first. It was debated whether they would even seep past the Eastern half of the star,
          but eventually they did. Quickly and without warning, contact with Elpis was lost.
          Knowing full well the dangers that could escape were the islands left unguarded—not to mention the
          many of their own people living and working there—Cynthia broke protocol and flew to their aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when she got there, it was once again all too late. The skies were red—the very trees rotting away—and not a soul was left to scream.
          It would only be a matter of days until the Final Days arrived in Amaurot. And despite her wishes,
          the Convocation would go ahead with the plan to summon Zodiark. Unbeknownst to her,
          both Hythlodaeus and her brother Athens would be among the sacrifices for that brighter future stained in blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the wake of her parents' demise, Venat had told her of the visitor from the future, and all that was to come.
          Even so, she never quite believed it until it happened. For how could anyone believe that *Amaurot* would fall?
          Nevertheless, she believed there was a fatal flaw in Venat's reasoning for what she planned to do.
          Having seen the things she had, Cynthia was convinced that in order for humanity to survive, despair must be purged.
          To wallow in it would bring about their very end, and thus must they start anew
        </p>
        <p>
          With this in mind, as the battle between Hydaelyn and Zodiark drew to a close, she placed herself between the two gods,
          withstanding their blows—and in so doing, absorbing their power. It was her hope that by doing this,
          she would be able to not only stop the sundering, but wipe the memories of every soul left within the city
          that they be spared the anguish in their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the end, she failed. And as the world slipped from her grasp, she spent the final vestiges of her energy completing the portal that would allow Emet-Selch, Lahabrea, and Elidibus to escape.
          <br>Whether or not her soul remained intact following the battle would remain a mystery for millennia.
