          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Fira is the current-day Warrior of Light of the Source, and shard of Cynthia, the final Azem.
            She is sweet, quiet and shy--in stark contrast to the outgoing nature of her previous shard iterations.
            She feels emotion and sentiment deeply, even if shy tries to distance herself from it as much as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike most people, Fira had a rather unusual start to life. One day, she simply awoke with no memories, past, or explanation as to why.
            The experiences she's had in the short life she's lead have given her a strong sense of duty, and made her see herself as less of a person,
            and more of a weapon poised to do what no one else can.

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Fira's story starts with the fulfillment of a legend. One in which, in Minfilia's words, there exists souls who are reborn upon the cusp of calamity to stay the encroaching Darkness.
          Unbeknownst to her, Fira was born by the will of Hydaelyn, who plucked her soul from the aetherial sea and gave it form. She was given life four years after the Seventh Umbral Calamity,
          at the physical age of around twenty summers. Her existence was had the purpose of filling the gaping void left by the previous Warrior of Light, Reina, who disappeared during the calamity.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Fira awoke for the first time in the Black Shroud, she found herself bereft of any memory of purpose. She was dressed in white, and her hair--naturally a dark purple--was bleached
          into a light violet due to the extended exposure to Hydaelyn's light. Her eyes were blue--a clear indication of her connection to Hydaelyn shared by her predecessors.
          She was found by a Miqo'te recluse named O'zrha Tia who took her in and taught her about the world. He gave her a name, and even taught her how to hunt.
          Around the time she decided to join the Adventurers' Guild, however, the man disappeared, and Fira was left lost and alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Left to fend for herself, Fira took just about any adventuring job she could find in order to make ends meet. This included those <i>outside</i> the Adventurers' Guild,
          which lead to her encountering some rather unsavory employers. Gullible and na&#239;ve, she got tricked into breaking her number one rule of never killing another human being,
          and this shook her to her core.
          She continued working as an adventurer, and eventually attracted the interest of the Scions, but her experiences stuck with her. Abandoned and used, she began to question her worth,
          and started shutting her true self away to become the soulless weapon she believed she needed to be. Having existed for so little time, and barely knowing who <i>she</i> was,
          her duty quite literally became her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, she loses any small amount of hope she had left that O'zrha would return, or that she'd find someone who knew her before what she assumed could only have been amnesia.
          She stops dying her hair, ties it up in pigtails to keep it out of the way and allow it to return to its natural dark purple.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the time Shadowbringers comes around and she meets Emet-Selch, she can't help but be drawn to him and his promises of a world without need for heroes.
          She yearns to be free of her duty, and to learn to <i>live</i>. If truly given the chance, there were multiple points in time where she would have joined him in a heartbeat.
          Alas, she did not, and behind closed doors his death destroyed her in ways even she couldn't explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the death of Elidibus, she found herself getting caught up with the Lemures and becoming a reaper. In them, she found a kinship of sorts, and gradually began to open up
          little by little. They managed to ground her, and bring her to remember why she became an adventurer in the first place. She wanted to help people; to see people smile.
          <br>It is with this renewed outlook on life that she tackles the events of Endwalker, and becomes the bastion of hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the moments of near-death following her final fight with Zenos, she meets with her past self, Cynthia, in a place somewhere between dream and the dynamis-influenced waking world.
          It is this encounter that allows her a glimpse of some of Cynthia's memories, which she will go on to treasure for the rest of her days.
