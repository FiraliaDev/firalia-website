          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            Reina was the Warrior of Light in the time of 1.0. Following the battle at Carteneau, she spent many years stuck in stasis within the Lifestream.
            In order to save her life, she became an Ascian, and regained some of her memories from her previous life as <a href="altheia.html">Altheia</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result of her time in the Lifestream, Reina has gone completely blind in one eye, and almost entirely blind in the other.
            The tips of her hair--once a deep purple that matched her eyes--have faded into a lighter violet.
            Like Y'shtola, she uses aether to see, though being immortal, it doesn't affect her lifespan in any way.

        <p><sup><b>Content Warning: Prostitution</b></sup></p>
        <p>
          Prior to the events of FFXIV 1.0, Reina was born into a loving family under the name Alera.
          At the age of 17, she awoke to the Echo, and upon reaching 19 summers, she left home to peruse greater horizons.
          Upon leaving the forest, as per custom, she changed her name to Reina Fatewalker.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a number of years prior to becoming an adventurer, Reina worked in various underground clubs and brothels.
          Having earnt the title of “The Enchantress”, she sold her services in quite a unique fashion.
          Mysteriously, she claimed to be able to recreate--and possibly even succeed--a person's greatest sexual encounter, simply by having them call the memory to mind.
          After becoming an adventurer by chance, and joining the Path of The Twelve, Reina found herself taking part in the Battle of Carteneau on the eve of the 7th calamity.
          Louisoix sent her into the future, but the spell backfired, leaving her stuck drifting in the Lifestream.
        </p>
        <p>
          For over 5 years, she drifted unconsciously; her blessing the only thing protecting her from complete disintegration.
          The ravenous currents of the Lifestream would eventually wear the blessing down, leaving the girl without its protection.
          Over the years--even with the blessing's protection--the Lifestream's energies had drained her almost completely of her sight.
          She went completely blind in her right eye, and partially in the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          One afternoon, Emet-Selch--then Solus zos Galvus--felt a strange disturbance in the Underworld.
          Something akin to a crack caught his curiosity, and upon seeing a familiar soul that by all means should not have been there,
          he brought her back to the safety of the mortal realm once more. Her aether was all wrong.
          It was jumbled and unsettled, and it took him hours to stabilize it.
          When he succeeded and the girl still did not wake, he ordered for her to be taken to a room of her own and sleep undisturbed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Months passed, and soon, Solus would leave the waking realm in favour of well-deserved slumber.
          Before he did, however, he insisted Elidibus take her, if only so he could hear the outcome of her mysterious circumstances when he awoke.
          As Emet-Selch had surmised, her coma-like state had been induced by a sudden change in her aether.
          Under the relentless torrents of the Lifestream, the girl's blessing had succumbed to the pressure with a crack, allowing the Lifestream to take its toll.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to save her life and restore balance to her soul, she was tempered to the will of Zodiark. After a number of years in stasis, she finally awoke.
          By the time she did, however, she was the only one left. Her caretakers were gone, and she was left to grapple with her newfound power and the fleeting memories of a life she once lived.
