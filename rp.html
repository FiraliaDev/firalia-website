          - Please respect my boundaries. Sometimes they're all over the place, so check if you're not sure.<br>
          - No inappropriate touching or ERP. (Some exclusions may apply to RP partners.)<br>
          - Just because I joke about doing something doesn't mean that I, the player, am actually comfortable doing it.<br>
          - Please respect how I characterise my muses. They may be a little different from what you'd expect, but they've each been shaped by their own sets of experiences.<br>
          - Screenshots are okay. Just ask and I'll strike a pose for you!<br>
        </p>

        <h3>For Roleplay Partners</h3>
        <p>
          It's worth noting that I, the player, am greysexual/greyromantic, which is a fancy way of saying I fall under the asexual umbrella.
          <br>As a result, romantic scenarios can be difficult for me at times, but that doesn't mean I don't enjoy them. Far from it! It just means I might need a little extra guidance and patience.
          If you see me go quiet, don't be afraid to check in with me OOC. There's a good chance I'm just stuck in my head wondering what to do and need a little nudge, but it's good to check either way!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'd like to know more about how my sexuality impacts how I roleplay, don't be afraid to reach out privately.
          <br>Some research into <a href="https://sexuality.fandom.com/wiki/Aegosexuality">aegosexuality</a> and <a href="https://www.lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Aegoromantic">aegoromanticism</a> is a great place to start!
